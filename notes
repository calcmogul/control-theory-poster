Intro to Control Theory Poster
* "How are autonomous vehicles controlled?"
* "How do we know if an autonomous car is stable?"
* "How can we prove autonomy is safe?"
* Define common terms and jargon
* Define transfer function -> poles and zeroes -> response chart
* PID as transfer func?
* root locus?
* State space equ?
* Digital z-plane stability?

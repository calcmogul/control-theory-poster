# Control Theory Poster

I made this poster for an undergraduate technical writing class I took at University of California, Santa Cruz in Spring 2017 ([CMPE 185](https://cmpe185-spring17-01.courses.soe.ucsc.edu/)). It covers control theory fundamentals, state-space, and optimal estimators. I designed it in [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/).
